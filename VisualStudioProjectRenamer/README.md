#Visual Studio Project Renamer
==============
This tool properly renames a Visual Studio Project and corrects all the references thoughout a solution.  To use, simply compile the project and run the VSPRGui.exe file.  

This project was "forked" from a [codeplex project](https://vsprenamer.codeplex.com/) and the credit goes to [Norman Koswell](http://normankosmal.com/wordpress/?page_id=184).  I just took the project and made it work within a solution and did a bit of refactoring.
